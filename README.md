1. PREFER VAL instead VAR because of the side effect in functional programming
1. "object" instead "class" private word means that is an instance of a object on runtime instead a class & extends "App" to have: "public static void main(String args[])" 
1. Use expressions instead loops, __AVOID__ loops are for imperative programming like Java & Python not for functional programming like Scala
